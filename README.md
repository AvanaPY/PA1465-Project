# Python
This program requires python 3.8.3 as of the time or the latest version that is supported by Tensorflow.

# Demo

## Start the web
* To start the web make sure to run `demo_ai.py` with python as a normal python file instead of using Flask as a module. So `python demo/demo_ai.py` and not `python -m flask run`. 
* `Upload Data` is yet not implemented.
* The AI is now integrated with the website, however it re-trains itself every time the webserver is restarted.
* The AI has loadable and saveable weights. You'll find those weights under `demo/ai_data` named `weights.h5` and/or `weights_prel.h5`. If `weights.h5` exists it will attempt to use those weights, otherwise it will retrain itself and save the weights as `weights_prel.h5`. It is your job as a user to change the name to `weights.h5` in order to make sure they're used the next time the server restarts.

## Config.ini

Create a config.ini file in the root directory with this content
```
[mysql]
host = localhost
database = python_mysql
user = root
password = hurrdurr

[app]
ip=localhost
port=hurrdurr
```

# Starting up a database

You can test-run the `database.py` file if you start up a mysql docker container and run the file. 

Pull the mysql docker image with 

```
docker pull mysql
```

Run the docker image with 

```
docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123 -d -p 3306:3306 mysql:latest
```

Let this be your config.ini file
```
[mysql]
host = localhost
database = mysql
user = root
password = 123
```

## Testing the database
Then run
```
python test.py
```
and it should work without problems.

# Database API

## API Functions
* create_sql_connection : `(filename, section)` &#8594; (my_db, db_config)
* create_table : `(cursor, table_name, column_dictionary)` &#8594; None
* show_databases : `()` &#8594; None 
* drop_table : `(cursor, table_name)` &#8594; None
* insert_data : `(cursor, table_name, column_dictionary, limit_offset, limit_row_count)` &#8594; None
* get_data : `(cursor, table_name, column_dictionary, order_by, order_by_asc_desc)` &#8594; `Queried_Data`
* delete_data : `(cursor, table_name, column_dictionary)` &#8594; None
* edit_data : `(cursor, table_name, column_dictionary, column_dictionary)` &#8594; None

## filename and section

The `filename` parameter in function `create_sql_connection` shall point to the `config.ini` file used to connect to the database, and the `section` parameter shall point to the section where the MySQL configuration is located.

## cursor

The `cursor` parameter is a MySQLConnection cursor instance that you can get by calling `my_db.cursor()` after having connected to the database using `create_sql_connection()`.

## table_name

A python string representing the name of the table you want to access.

## Queried_Data
A list of tuples where each tuple is representing the MySQL database row queried for. This list can include more than one item.

## column_dictionary

A column_dictionary is a python dictionary that indicates which column should receive which value in the database. An example of a column dictionary would be:
```
{
    'name':'cogitel',
    'age':420
}
```
where the column `name` will receive the value `'cogitel'` and column `age` will receive the value `420`. Note that the user must know beforehand the names of the columns except in the function `create_table` where the table itself is created. create_table also uses a specific `column dictionary` style where it's a `column-name-to-column-type` mapping instead, such as:
```
{
    'id':'INTEGER(6) AUTOINCREMENT',
    'name':'VARCHAR(255)',
    'age':'INTEGER(6)'
}
```

## order_by and order_by_asc_desc

Whether to order the query in any specific manner. 
* order_by: list[str] specifices which columns to order by.
* order_by_asc_desc: 'ASC' for ascending or 'DESC' for descending.

## limit_offset and limit_row_count

Whether or not the SQL query should limit its length.
* limit_offset: int specifies the offset in the starting row.
* limit_row_count: int specifies the maximum number of rows it should return.
