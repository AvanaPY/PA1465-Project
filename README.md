# Python
This program requires python 3.8.3 as of the time or the latest version that is supported by Tensorflow.

# Demo

## Start the web
* To start the web make sure to run `demo_ai.py` with python as a normal python file instead of using Flask as a module. So `python demo/demo_ai.py` and not `python -m flask run`. 
* `Upload Data` is yet not implemented.
* The AI is now integrated with the website, however it re-trains itself every time the webserver is restarted.
* The AI has loadable and saveable weights. You'll find those weights under `demo/ai_data` named `weights.h5` and/or `weights_prel.h5`. If `weights.h5` exists it will attempt to use those weights, otherwise it will retrain itself and save the weights as `weights_prel.h5`. It is your job as a user to change the name to `weights.h5` in order to make sure they're used the next time the server restarts.

## Config.ini

Create a config.ini file in the root directory with this content
```
[mysql]
host = localhost
database = python_mysql
user = root
password = hurrdurr

[app]
ip=localhost
port=hurrdurr
```

# Setting up a database and starting the service.

Let this be your config.ini file
```
[mysql]
host = localhost
database = mysql
user = root
password = 123

[app]
ip=0.0.0.0
port=1234
```

## MySQL database with Docker
You can test-run the `database.py` file if you start up a mysql docker container and run the file. 

Pull the mysql docker image with 

```
docker pull mysql
```

Run the docker image with 

```
docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123 -d -p 3306:3306 mysql:latest
```

## Building the project into a docker container

`git pull` for any new changes.

Then run
``` 
docker build --tag unique-project-name .
```
in order to build the project into a docker file. This can take a while.


## Running the project docker container

After that run
```
docker run --name cogitel -p 1234:1234 -p 8888:3306 -e MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST=172.17.0.2 -e MYSQL_DATABASE_PORT=3306 unique-project-name
```

NOTES:
* The ip address (MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST) will be the local ip address to the MySQL docker container, on our test systems it defaulted to 172.17.0.2 but it may be different on yours. To check the ip address of the docker container simply call `docker inspect mysql` and look for "ip address" in the output.
* MYSQL_DATABASE_PORT is defaulted to 3306 when starting up the MySQL docker container, however this can change if the user wants it to. 

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
* MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST refers to the ip-address of the MySQL database, defaults to 172.17.0.2.
* MYSQL_DATABASE_PORT refers to the port of the MySQL address, defaults to 3306 
## Testing the database
Then run
```
python test.py
```
and it should work without problems.


# Readme and user manual for AI prediction

This guide aims to guide users and developers on how various aspects of the program functions and goes into more details in how specific functions operate. This guide is aimed at a broad audience while including technical information.

**The following steps need to be done before the program can begin detecting anomalies.** 

## Database:

### Config.ini

Create a config.ini file in the root directory with this content

```

[mysql]

host = localhost        #exchange this if the database is not locally hosted. 

database = python_mysql #exchange this with your own database

user = root             #exchange this with your own username

password = password     #exchange this with your own password

[app]

ip=localhost    #exchange this with the appropriate ip. 

port=port       #exchange this with the appropriate port

```

### Starting up a database

You can test-run the `database.py` file if you start up a mysql docker container and run the file. # No you can't

Pull the mysql docker image with

```

docker pull mysql

```

Run the docker image with

```

docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123 -d -p 3306:3306 mysql:latest

```

Let this be your config.ini file

```

[mysql]

host = localhost

database = mysql

user = root

password = 123

```

### Upload data to database

Run `wsgy.py` in terminal by typing:

```
python wsgy.py

* edit_data : `(cursor, table_name, column_dictionary, column_dictionary)` &#8594; None

## Variables

### filename and section

The `filename` parameter in function `create_sql_connection` shall point to the `config.ini` file used to connect to the database, and the `section` parameter shall point to the section where the MySQL configuration is located.

### cursor

The `cursor` parameter is a MySQLConnection cursor instance that you can get by calling `my_db.cursor()` after having connected to the database using `create_sql_connection()`.

### table_name

A python string representing the name of the table you want to access.

### Queried_Data
A list of tuples where each tuple is representing the MySQL database row queried for. This list can include more than one item.

### column_dictionary

A column_dictionary is a python dictionary that indicates which column should receive which value in the database. An example of a column dictionary would be:
```
{
    'name':'cogitel',
    'age':420
}
```
where the column `name` will receive the value `'cogitel'` and column `age` will receive the value `420`. Note that the user must know beforehand the names of the columns except in the function `create_table` where the table itself is created. create_table also uses a specific `column dictionary` style where it's a `column-name-to-column-type` mapping instead, such as:
```
{
    'id':'INTEGER(6) AUTOINCREMENT',
    'name':'VARCHAR(255)',
    'age':'INTEGER(6)'
}
```

### result

A python list of strings of all table names in the database.

### order_by and order_by_asc_desc

Whether to order the query in any specific manner. 
* order_by: list[str] specifices which columns to order by.
* order_by_asc_desc: 'ASC' for ascending or 'DESC' for descending.

### limit_offset and limit_row_count

Whether or not the SQL query should limit its length.
* limit_offset: int specifies the offset in the starting row.
* limit_row_count: int specifies the maximum number of rows it should return.

### delete_data

Deletes a datapoint in `table_name` matching the criteria in `column_dictionary`.
